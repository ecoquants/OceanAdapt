## How we process the data:  
- We group the data by YEAR, SEASON, LAT, LON, DEPTH, CRUISE6, STATION, STRATUM, and SVSPP and summarise the BIOMASS to calculate wtcpue.  
- We create a haulid by combining a 6 digit leading zero cruise number with a 3 digit leading zero station number and a 4 digit leading zero stratum number, separated by "-", for example: (cruise-station-stratum) 456354-067-0001.  
- We convert square nautical miles to square kilometers.  
- We remove any SCINAME spp values that contain the word "egg" or "unidentified", or where the only value in the SCINAME field is white space.  
- We group the data by haulid, stratum, stratumarea, year, lat, lon, depth,  and spp and then sum up all of the wtcpue values for each group and reassign that as the wtcpue.
- We separate the trawls into Fall and Spring seasons.
