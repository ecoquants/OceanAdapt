# Detailed Metadata
The data we report on OceanAdapt are curated from several data sources. Our curated data takes the form of several tables described here:

-   [all-regions-full.RData](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean/all-regions-full.RData) is a table containing all rows from all regions with the following columns:
    -   region - character - the region where the survey occurred.
    -   haulid - character - a unique identifier of the trawl haul.
    -   year - numeric (YYYY) - the year the trawl occurred.
    -   lat - numeric - the latitude in decimal degrees where the trawl occurred.
    -   lon - numeric - the longitude in decimal degrees where the trawl occurred.
    -   stratum - numeric - the stratum code where the trawl occurred.
    -   depth - numeric - the depth in meters of the trawl.
    -   spp - character - the Genus and species of the organism captured in the trawl.
    -   common - character - the common name of the organism captured in the trawl.
    -   wtcpue - numeric - the weight in kilograms captured per unit effort.
-   [all-regions-trimmed.RData](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean/all-regions-trimmed.RData) is the all-regions\_full table reduced to include only species present at least 3/4 of the available years in a survey. The columns are the same as those listed above.
-   [by\_national.RData](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean/by_national.RData) is a table of national averages by year for the trawl surveys with the following columns:
    -   year - numeric (YYYY) - the year the trawl occurred.
    -   lat - numeric - the mean latitude in decimal degrees where all trawls occurred.
    -   lon - numeric - the mean longitude in decimal degrees where all trawls occurred.
    -   depth - numeric - the mean depth in meters of all trawls.
    -   lat\_se - numeric - the standard error of the mean latitude.
    -   lonse - numeric - the standard error of the mean longitude.
    -   depth\_se - numeric - the standard error of the mean depth.
    -   numspp - numeric - the total number of species observed that year.
-   [by\_region.RData](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean/by_region.RData) is a table of regional averages by year for the trawl surveys with the following columns:
    -   region - character - the region where the survey occurred.
    -   year - numeric (YYYY) - the year the trawl occurred.
    -   lat - numeric - the mean latitude in decimal degrees where all trawls occurred.
    -   lon - numeric - the mean longitude in decimal degrees where all trawls occurred.
    -   depth - numeric - the mean depth in meters of all trawls.
    -   lat\_se - numeric - the standard error of the mean latitude.
    -   lonse - numeric - the standard error of the mean longitude.
    -   depth\_se - numeric - the standard error of the mean depth.
    -   numspp - numeric - the total number of species observed that year in that region.
-   [by\_species.RData](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean/by_species.RData) is a table of averages by species for the trawl surveys with the following columns:
    -   region - character - the region where the survey occurred.
    -   year - numeric (YYYY) - the year the trawl occurred.
    -   lat - numeric - the mean latitude in decimal degrees where the species was found in a given year.
    -   lon - numeric - the mean longitude in decimal degrees where the species was found in a given year.
    -   depth - numeric - the mean depth in meters where the species was found in a given year.
    -   lat\_se - numeric - the standard error of the mean latitude.
    -   lonse - numeric - the standard error of the mean longitude.
    -   depth\_se - numeric - the standard error of the mean depth.
    -   spp - character - the Genus and species of the organism captured in the trawl.
    -   common - character - the common name of the organism captured in the trawl.
-   [dat\_exploded.RData](https://github.com/pinskylab/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean/by_species.RData) a table where all species found in a region occupy a row in the table in all years and represented with zeros when not observed. The table is made up of the same columns as all-data-full and all-data-trimmed.
