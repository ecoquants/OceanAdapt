## data_raw folder   
contains data that are downloaded from the websites of various government agencies. Raw data is regionally sourced and those sources are the best place to find the most current information about the raw data:  
- [Alaska Fisheries Science Center - NOAA](https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/survey_data/metadata_template.php?fname=RACEweb.xml) - This NOAA center provides data for the Aleutian Islands, Eastern Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska.  
- [Northwest Fisheries Science Center - NOAA](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/research/divisions/fram/index.cfm) - This NOAA center provides data for the West Coast Triennial and West Coast Annual surveys.  
- [Gulf States Marine Fisheries online SEAMAP access ](https://seamap.gsmfc.org/documents/SEAMAP_Data_Structures.pdf) - This program provides data for the Gulf of Mexico.  
- [Northeast Fisheries Science Center](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/rcb/projects/ntap/) - This NOAA center provides data for the Northeast US.  
- [SEAMAP South Atlantic](https://www2.dnr.sc.gov/seamap/Account/LogOn?ReturnUrl=%2fseamap%2fReports) - This program provides data for the Southeast US.  
- [Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/index-eng.htm) - Canada DFO provides data for the Scotian Shelf.


## compile.R script  
generates tables that vary slightly from the orignal raw data.  All of these tables can be found as RData in the [data_clean](https://github.com/mpinsky/OceanAdapt/tree/update_2019/data_clean) folder.  Descriptions of the tables follow.  
- [all-regions-full.RData](https://github.com/mpinsky/OceanAdapt/blob/update_2019/data_clean/all-regions-full.RData) - all of the raw data from all regions, combined, and reduced to the following columns:  

    - region - the region where the trawl survey was conducted.
    - haulid - a unique identifier of each tow.
    - year - the year the survey was conducted in %YYYY format.
    - lat - the latitude where the tow was conducted in decimal units.
    - lon - the longitude where the tow was conducted in decimal units.
    - stratum - the stratum identifier for the tow.
    - stratumarea - the area in km^2 covered by the tow.
    - depth - the depth in meters of the tow.
    - spp - the scientific name of the species observed in the tow.
    - common - the common name of the speices observed in the tow.
    - wtcpue - the weight of catch per unit effort for the species in the tow.  
- [all-regions-trimmed.RData](https://github.com/mpinsky/OceanAdapt/blob/update_2019/data_clean/all-regions-trimmed.RData) - the full data table above reduced to include only speices that are in present in at least 3/4 of the years for each region.
