These are the raw data files for each bottom trawl survey, as originally provided by each data source. Each sub-directory corresponds to an update (generally annually). Inside are sub-directories for each survey, each of which contains a dated zip file with the complete set of data files from that survey as of that date.

The data sources are as follows (see links):  
  + [AI](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/survey_data/default.htm)  
  + [EBS](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/survey_data/default.htm)  
  + [GOA](http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/RACE/groundfish/survey_data/default.htm)  
  + NEUS ("Sean Lucey <Sean.Lucey@noaa.gov>")  
  + [GMEX](http://seamap.gsmfc.org/)  
  + WCANN ("Beth Horness" <beth.horness@noaa.gov>)  
  + *WCTRI no longer udpated*  
  + [SA/ SEUS](in progress, ask Jim Morley for what to do)
