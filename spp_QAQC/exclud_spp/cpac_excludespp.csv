Belonella borealis,Canadian Pacific,FALSE,Maria Cornwaithe,3/29/21,"I have no information to provide on these particular species. Some (all?) of them may be encountered on groundfish surveys. If there are specific questions about any particular species, IÕd be happy to answer them, or refer the questions to the appropriate person in the Groundfish Section or elsewhere. Organisms encountered on groundfish surveys are identified in the field to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Experienced individuals are responsible for overseeing the identifications in the field and questionable specimens are photographed and/or retained for further investigation. Other than that, questions are addressed on an ad hoc basis Ð for example, when a researcher discovers something unusual in a dataset and asks for corroboration."
