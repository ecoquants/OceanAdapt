# Our Method

The distributions of fish and invertebrate populations are routinely monitored by DFO, NMFS, and other agencies during bottom trawl surveys on the continental shelves of North America (see the metadata link below for details on data sources). These surveys provide core information for use in fisheries management and extend back two to five decades. For the indicators displayed on this website, a mean location (the centroid) is calculated for each species in each year of each survey, after the surveys have been standardized to a consistent spatial footprint through time. The centroid is the mean latitude and mean depth of catch in the survey, weighted by biomass.

For the regional and national indices, the first year is standardized to a value of zero and changes are then averaged across species in a region. Only regions with consistent survey methods and without coastlines that would prevent poleward shifts in distribution are included in the national average (currently Eastern Bering Sea and Northeast U.S.). Only species caught every year are analyzed to prevent changes in species composition from affecting the indicator. The indicator begins in the first year that data are available from the focal regions.

The historical analyses and data are described in Pinsky, M. L., B. Worm, M. J. Fogarty, J. L. Sarmiento, and S. A. Levin. 2013. Marine taxa track local climate velocities. Science 341: 1239-1242 doi: [10.1126/science.1239352](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1239352) (free reprint available from [pinsky.marine.rutgers.edu/publications](http://pinsky.marine.rutgers.edu/publications/)).

The projections of future species distributions were developed from statistical relationships between ocean temperature, bottom habitat features, and species abundance. Ocean temperature projections for the future were from global climate models developed for the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/). Full methods are described in Morley, J. W., R. L. Selden, R. J. Latour, T. L. Fr√∂licher, R. J. Seagraves, and M. L. Pinsky. 2018.

# News


## 2021/02/14 - OceanAdapt update 2021.1

- this is a patch for update 2021 (described below) in which a problem with duplicated records in the Maritimes region was fixed (issue #152) and the 'data_clean' folder was updated and tidied up.

## 2021/12/21 - OceanAdapt update 2021

  - Expanded coverage to three new regions in Canada: Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSLnor), Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSLsouth), and the Canadian Pacific (CPAC). 
  - 2019 data added for the Gulf of Alaska, the Maritimes regions (formerly Scotian Shelf), and Southeast US. 
  - 2020 data were not available for most regions due to survey difficulties resulting from the COVID19 pandemic. If they were available, they only covered a small portion of the survey region. 
  - A website update is pending, but expected to occur soon. 
  
## 2021/10/25 - OceanAdapt provides indicators for National Marine Ecosystem Status

- The regional latitude and depth centroids from OceanAdapt are now part of the National Marine Ecosystem Status system [here](https://ecowatch.noaa.gov/). 

## 2021/06/09 - data have been added to OceanAdapt\! - website update pending

  - New data are available via this GitHub! Website update is pending, but expected to occur in July 2021. We have expanded to three new regions in Canada: Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSLnor), Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSLsouth), and the Canadian Pacific (CPAC). 2019 data were added for the Gulf of Alaska, the Maritimes regions (formerly Scotian Shelf), and Southeast US. 2020 data were not available for most regions due to survey difficulties through the COVID19 pandemic. If they were available, they only covered a small portion of the survey region.
