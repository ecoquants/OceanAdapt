		LATITUDE: latitude at start of a survey haul
		LONGITUDE: longitude at start of a survey haul
		STATION: station identication number for the haul
		STRATUM: statistical stratum of the haul
		YEAR: year of haul
		DATETIME: date and local time of the haul in MM/DD/YYYYHH:MM
		WTCPUE: weight in KG/hectare. -9999 for NA
		NUMCPUE: number, in number/hectrare. -9999 for NA
		COMMON: common name
		SCIENTIFIC: scientific name
		SID: species ID
		BOT_DEPTH: depth of the bottom at the location of the haul
		BOT_TEMP: temperature at the bottom
		SURF_TEMP: surface temperature
		VESSEL: vessel identification ID
		CRUISE: cruise identification ID
		HAUL: haul identification ID

		Area for each statistical stratum in the Aleutian Islands.
	
		SubareaDescription: subarea name
